## What is the Dragon Curve ?
Foremost, the Dragon Curve is a fractal, in mathematics, fractal is a term used to describe geometric shapes containing detailed structure at arbitrarily small scales. Many fractals appear similar at various scales.

The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although there are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.
